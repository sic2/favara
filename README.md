# sciabaca
A geo-restricted aggregator of FB events

**sciabaca** (or sciàbaca or sciabachèju) is an **Siculo-Arabic** word meaning: fishing net. The Siculo-Arabic language is dead now (IX-XIV century), but we believe it sounds great and its meaning really reflects the purpose of the project.

## Goals

The main goal of **sciabaca** is to aggregate community events happening within a given geographical region, categorize them, and allow users to explore and find events via a webapp.

## How to run

First of all, make sure that you have ruby installed. Then install all required dependencies
> $ cd webapp
> $ bundle install

And finally just run **sciabaca**:
> $ cd webapp
> $ ruby sciabaca.rb

## Notes

This could be considered a sister-project of **isamuni**.
