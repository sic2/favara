# sciabaca
A geo-restricted aggregator of FB events

**sciabaca** (or sciàbaca or sciabachèju) is an **Siculo-Arabic** word meaning: fishing net. The Siculo-Arabic language is dead now (IX-XIV century), but we believe it sounds great and its meaning really reflects the purpose of the project.


## Goals

The main goal of **sciabaca** is to aggregate community events happening within a given geographical region, categorize them, and allow users to explore and find events via a webapp.

## Notes

This could be considered a sister-project of **isamuni**.
